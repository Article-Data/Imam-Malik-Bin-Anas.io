<h1 style="color:Gold; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> <u> IMAM MALIK BIN ANAS </u> </b> </h1> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size:15px; text-align:center;"> <b> Imam Malik bin Anas, commonly known as Imam Malik 
was born in the year 93 AH(After Hijrat) in the city of Madina.<br>
Imam Malik was the founder of second school of Islamic legal thought, the MALIKI school of thought and was the second of four great Imams of Islam.
Imam Malik was of Yemeni origin. <br>
He was described as being very tall and imposing in stature. He had a very fair hair. He also had a huge beard
and blue eyes.
</b> </p> <br>


<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px;"> Imam Malik studied under very acclaimed scholars and teachers, one of them being Imam Abu Hanifa.
This explains the many years of peace and mutual respect that existed between the Maliki school and the Hanafi school.
The Imam began studying at the very young age of 10. He was dedicated to learning about Hadiths that he would often wait outside in the hot sun to ask 
his teacher a question about a Hadith he learned about during the class.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px;"> Some of the teachers of IMAM MALIK were: <br>
Rabiyahr Ra'i <br>
Ibn Hurmaz <br>
Nafi' Ibn Umar <br>
Ibn Shihab Zuhri <br>
Imam Jafar Al-Sadiq(Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu) <br>
Muhammad Ibn Al Munkadir <br>
Abdur Rahman Ibn Al Qasim <br>
Abdullah Ibn Wahab <br>
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px;"> One of his most memorable achievements was his role in gathering of the Hadiths to make the golden chain.<br>
These Hadiths are some of the most authentic Hadiths that exist today. His Students put these Hadiths in a book called 'Al-Muwatta'. <br>
Although some people thought that Imam Malik got along pretty well with the state officials of Medina, however, this is far from the truth.<br>
The Imam endured a trial at the hand of the caliph at the time 'Abu Ja'far Al-Mansur'. This all started when a politically motivated 
question was asked to Imam Malik.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px; text-align:center;"> 
The question was, <br>'If a Man was forced to divorce his wife and he divorced her, would the divorce count?'<br>
The Imam's response was, "The Divorce of the coerced does not take effect". <br>
Due to it's political application to the coerced pledged(ba'ya) to the caliph then in effect, the Imam was forbidden to say this.<br>
A spy then asked the same question to test him and the Imam responded the same. <br>
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px;"> The Governor of Madina(the cousin of the Caliph at the time) seized Imam Malik and lashed him until his arms were
dislocated and passed out. Imam Malik persisted even after being shaved and put on the back of a Camel and kept on saying, <br>
The Divorce of the coerced is null and void! When the news reached Ja'far, he released Imam Malik.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px;"> Imam Malik was highly respected amongst the scholars.<br>
Even the first Imam Abu Hanifa would recommend scholars of Medina to Imam Malik saying, <br>
"If there is any excellence in them it lies in the fair-haired, blue-eyed youth".<br>
He remained respected until his death at the age of 90 in the year 179 AH(After Hijrat).
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px;"> Abu Hanifa's response did not sit well with Mohammad Al-Mansur. Abu Hanifah was punished by imprisonment and flogging. <br>
He kept talking about the corruption done by the Government. The Government got so annoyed and they poisoned his Food. He died at the age of 70 in Baghdad in the year 767. <br>
Imam Abu Hanifah passed away in the state of prostation(Sajda). When he died, he left instructions that he should not be buried in any land which the ruler had 
misappropriated. The whole town came out to pay their last homage to the greatest Imam of Islamic Law. It was said that so many people attended his Janazah(Funeral) that the 
Funeral Service was repeated 6 times for more than 50,000 people who had amassed before he was actually buried.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 15px; text-align: center;"> Some of the books written by Imam Abu Hanifah: <br>
1. Al-Muwatta (The Approved) <br>
2. Al-Mudawwana Al-Kubra <br>
